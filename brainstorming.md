## Categorize and Evaluate

### Bar Hopping App
- **Mobile**
   - This app can have live comments from the night that could let users know how the scene is for the night. Having an app that updates throughout the night is better than having to use a website. We would implement maps and location so that users can find a nearby bar easily.
- **Story**
    - You and a group of friends are on vacation in a town you are not familiar with and you want to go bar hopping. However, none of you know where the best bars are and no one wants to risk going to a bar having a slow night or one in a dangerous area. By using our app, you could have access to live updates from people in the area so that you know what bars are the best to go to. Friends and peers of ours that like to go out and have a night on the town would appreciate apps like this.
- **Market**
    - Our main market would be people in college and young adults going out for a night of fun. While older people may use our app, this app will likely not appeal to anyone below the age of 18, or not in college as they won't be going to bars at such a young age. An app like this has a lot of value to people who like to party and try new places.
- **Scope**
    - This app is probably our most ambitious and the one that would require scaling back. We would have to connect to an API that would provide information on bars, one example is Google Places. We would like to show a map within the app but that is a feature we may have to scale back. Also, if the use of the API proves to costly, we may have to find an alternative or hard code in bars for demo purposes.

### Travel Planing App
- **Mobile**
    - Functionality would include the ability for users to create accounts and plan the items they intend to take for their trip. We would implement the ability to plan for different types of trips such as flight, hiking, roadtrip etc. Flights have max weight limits and hikes have reccommended weight limits based off of the hikers body weight so we could give alerts if the user overpacks. Users would need to input the items they are bringing along with the weight. 
    - We would allow users to download a pdf/csv file of their trip inventory as hikes may be in areas that lack cell service. We would implement a database for data persistence and connect to the camera so that the user can add an image of items if they wish.
- **Story**
    - Have you ever packed for a flight and it turned out you were just overweight for the carry on limit? Or you packed for a hike and as the hike is going on, you are now suffering from back pain due to overpacking? Now you need to go through your bags and find what you can get rid of so that you can meet the weight limits. Our app has an itemized list so this makes the process of cutting weight significantly easier. This is an app that would appeal to friends and peers preparing for trips.
- **Market**
    - The market for this app is very large as it would appeal to anyone taking a trip of any type. This is especially useful for people who have trips often as having the ability to look at what was packed for past trips can help avoid forgetting items for an upcoming trip.
- **Habit**
    - Users would only use this app when they are going on trips which makes it not very useful for everyday use unless you travel frequently.
- **Scope**
    - An app like this is very achievable by the end of the semester. Nothing seems unachievable so there should be no reason to make a stripped down version of the app.
### Note Taking App
- **Mobile**
  - Functionality would include the ability to store audio recordings and pictures. This note taking app would be able to function without the need of internet making it more convenient than a website.
- **Story**
  - It is common for someone to need to store a password, phone number, shopping list, etc. and need to be able to access them at a moment's notice. There is also no androids equivalent to the notes app on IOS so friends and peers on Android would appreciate this.
- **Market**
    - An app like this would appeal to most people as there will always be the need to record data. This app doesn't target a niche but instead targets the average user giving it widespread appeal.
- **Habit**
    - The idea is to make this app second nature to users whenever they need to record data. We want it to be as convenient and feature complete as possible to attract users and to make it their go to note taking app.
- **Scope**
    - We think that this app is achievable by the end of the program. The ability to save audio recordings may be out of scope but every other aspect of the app seems achievable.
