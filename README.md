## Overview

### Description

Packer is an app for helping you plan for your Trip. It will help you keep track of the weight of items as you pack by logging them and totaling the weight of items for you. Packer can be used to efficiently trim items from your bag until you reach your target weight.

### App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Mobile**
    - Functionality would include the ability for users to create accounts and plan the items they intend to take for their trip. We would implement the ability to plan for different types of trips such as flight, hiking, roadtrip etc. Flights have max weight limits and hikes have reccommended weight limits based off of the hikers body weight so we could give alerts if the user overpacks. Users would need to input the items they are bringing along with the weight. 
    - We would allow users to download a pdf/csv file of their trip inventory as hikes may be in areas that lack cell service. We would implement a database for data persistence and connect to the camera so that the user can add an image of items if they wish.
- **Story**
    - Have you ever packed for a flight and it turned out you were just overweight for the carry on limit? Or you packed for a hike and as the hike is going on, you are now suffering from back pain due to overpacking? Now you need to go through your bags and find what you can get rid of so that you can meet the weight limits. Our app has an itemized list so this makes the process of cutting weight significantly easier. This is an app that would appeal to friends and peers preparing for trips.
- **Market**
    - The market for this app is very large as it would appeal to anyone taking a trip of any type. This is especially useful for people who have trips often as having the ability to look at what was packed for past trips can help avoid forgetting items for an upcoming trip.
- **Habit**
    - Users would only use this app when they are going on trips which makes it not very useful for everyday use unless you travel frequently.
- **Scope**
    - An app like this is very achievable by the end of the semester. Nothing seems unachievable so there should be no reason to make a stripped down version of the app.
